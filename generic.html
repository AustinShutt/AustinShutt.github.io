									<p>I find myself drawn most to performance and efficiency in software. I am constantly reading books that improve my understanding of how
									   software interacts with the hardware and how one can write high level code using a language such as C++ and have the compiler assist in
									   turning that high level code in to code that can run well in the target environment.
									</p>
									<p>
										Overall application architecture and best team practices have been my focus lately as I explore the benefits of continuous delivery models
										and test driven software. I am currently enrolled to receive a computer science degree, however curiosity drives my education much more than
										any assignment ever could. I have invited a friend to work on a project collaboratively to be able to actively practice some of the industry
										best practices that I have been reading about when it comes to group coding.

									<h2>Employment History</h2>
									<p>I currently do freelance software development running a <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/archonite">Fiverr storefront</a> in which I produce
										 small coding projects for customers on the site. This has allowed me to gain a great knowledge base of a select few languages and exposure
										to a number of diverse problem sets. Maybe more importantly it has taught me to speak to an end user about software purpose, design, 
										and customer satisfaction when working on a project.</p>

									<p>I am a Navy Veteran and had a fantastic ~7 years in the U.S. Navy as a Search and Rescue Medical Techician flying in the MH-60S performing
										high altitude aerial rescue in the Pacific Northwest. I flew over 165 live missions and ~1500 flight hours. I was eventually in an enlisted leadership position
										in which I directly trained and equipped well over 15 aircrew in rappel/hoist operations and medical evaluations at a world class level. During
										my time there I produced a couple videos of what our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D99TSD8bzu4">experience </a> was like.
